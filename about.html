                <p>I am a multi-disciplinary artist and soon-to-be software engineer currently living in San Francisco, California.</p>
                <p>Originally from Florida, I attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon, and received a degree in Russian Language with a focus on film translation. Curious minds can view a sample of my thesis work, subtitling the works of Soviet animator Vladimir Kobrin, <a href="https://vimeo.com/162935314">here!</a></p>
                <p>After a brief period of time living in Russia, I moved to San Francisco both to pursue my interest in the burgeoning makerspace movement, and to live a more authentic, out life as a transgender indivdual. 
                    I worked at TechShop in SoMa as an instructor and lead of their sales and membership deparment, and still volunteer teaching industrial laser cutter safety and operation at the San Francisco non-profit makerspace Humanmade.</p>
                <p>Together with my life partner, I perform regularly around San Francisco as my drag alter-ego Franzia Kafka. I also produce Media Meltdown, a cult movie and media-focused drag show, out of the historic Balboa Theater in the Richmond district of San Francisco.</p>
